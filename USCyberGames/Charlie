Find the flag

***

## Process

We are provided a file with several other files within it. While looking throuhg them, I noticed they didn't lead anywhere, so the 

flag must be contained within the file itself. I looked over txt file and found that it was actually a base64 encoded jpg. 

I viewed the image and got the flag.
