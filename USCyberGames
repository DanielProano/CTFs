# Cookie (web challenge)

***

## Description

When simply given a website, find the flag. The challenge is named cookie and the picture is of a mouse with a cookie, hinting that

we need to first look at the cookies.

## Attempts

I spent an hour trying to find any clues. The site as very minimalistic and I didn't find much at first. Then

I checked /robots.txt and found clue #2, which lead me to /admin. There, I found the user and pass to login.

I found the fourth clue within the home page. I didn't have the first clue so I looked around for a little bit.

I came back to the cookie which I visited first and realized I could decode it, which when I did, revealed the first 

clue. Putting them together and converting it from Base64, I found the flag.
