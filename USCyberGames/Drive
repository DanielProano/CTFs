# Drive (forensics)

The challenge provides a file which I can decompress and get more files.

## Attempts

I first spent half an hour getting a feel for the hierarchy and depth of the files. There were three files in total: a text file

that provided vague instructions, a .001 file which contained a lot of different files that I explored, and finally a .zip file which repeated

all of these files again and again, making this an extremely large file system. I saw that there were pngs avaliable that did not get outputted when 

I binwalked so I tried to manually extract them. This took awhile so I ended it early and saw that it wasn't anything useful. I then got the idea to 

String some files and see their contents and thats when I found the flag in one of the internal files.
