# Silent Signal

We are given a pcap file

# Process

I first tried putting the file in Wireshark. I noticed there was a warning that

the file was cut short or imporperly formatted. I then looked throught the file and 

then tried using tshark on the pcap. I found nothing interesting. Then, I got a clue

from the title, that the signal was silent and began looking for more creative ways

to hide the flag, eventually figuring out that the times listed with the file were 

important. Using those times, I found the differences and converted them to chars,

finding the flag
